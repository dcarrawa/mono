1. Follow the initial build instructions described here -- https://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/windows/
2. Copy your installed version of Mono somewhere else so it doesn't get destroyed (i.e. D:/GitHub/godotfork/patched_mono_for_godot_windows_x64/)
3. Use the copy as your prefix.
	- export PREFIX=C:/Users/devin/Documents/GitHub/MonoForGodot/
    - export PATH=$PREFIX/bin:$PATH
4. Make sure mono from program files is in your path (you should be able to type mono in cygwin and see output), you may also need the Windows 8.1 SDK
5. Run the following commands from cygwin (as administrator!)
	- ./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --enable-msvc --disable-boehm
	- make -j4
    - make install
